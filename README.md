# Puente Backend Application

Cloud Code is easy to use because it’s built on the JavaScript SDK for parse-server. The only difference is that this code runs in our Parse Server rather than running on the user’s mobile device. When we update your Cloud Code, it becomes available to all mobile environments instantly. 


Goal:
To move all resource intensive services to the cloud code in an organized manner.
